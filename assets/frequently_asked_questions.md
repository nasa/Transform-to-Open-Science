# NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Frequently Asked Questions 
### What is open-source science (OSS)?
Open-source science is a commitment to the open sharing of software, data, and knowledge (algorithms, papers, documents, ancillary information) from the start of research activities. The principles of OSS are to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. OSS is enabled by advances in technology, including collaboration tools and cloud computing. More information is available from NASA's [Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Policy Document (SPD-41) on science information policy.](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf)
### What is the difference between OSS and open science?
[Ramachandran et al.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020EA001562) define open science as “a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding.” The primary difference is that open-source science commits to making the scientific process open from the start of research activities rather than making research results open once the research is complete and papers are published. The commitment to conduct research in the open supports greater participation in answering fundamental scientific questions and the use of publicly funded research, data, and analysis for societal benefit.
### What is the difference between OSS and open data?
Open data are a critical component of open-source science. Other components of OSS include open documentation, publications, citizen science, challenges/prizes, open-source software, open peer review, open notebooks, and open educational resources among others.
### Who can participate?
Anyone with an interest in open science is welcome to participate in TOPS. 
[Sign up for the TOPS newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) to learn how to get involved and keep up-to-date with the latest TOPS activities,
### What is the Year of Open Science?
Transform to Open Science (TOPS) is a five-year initiative designed to support scientists, agencies, organizations, and communities as they transform to an inclusive culture of open science. Many TOPS activities will be focused around 2023 as NASA’s Year of Open Science. In partnership with major scientific organizations, the Year of Open Science is designed to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will shift the current paradigm.

### Is the lack of OSS a cultural or technical issue?
Both. Open science is more than just the open sharing of data and code. It also is a cultural shift in the scientific process that encourages collaboration among people of diverse backgrounds, including scientific field, gender, location, ethnicity, and expertise. By removing barriers to participation in the scientific process, open-source science is inherently inclusive and collaborative. NASA’s vision is to use open science principles to expand participation in the scientific process, improve reproducibility, and accelerate scientific discovery for societal benefit. Technological considerations include use of existing investments in infrastructure and mechanisms for community contributions, while limiting the proliferation of unvalidated data. 
### Does OSS mean free science?
Open science is the commitment to the full, free, and open sharing of data, code and knowledge as early in the research process as possible. 
In terms of activities related to NASA’s [Open-Source Science Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science), [Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Policy Document (SPD-41)](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf) consolidates existing guidance for the openness and accessibility of data, software, papers, and ancillary information resulting from SMD-funded efforts
### This sounds difficult, what is the first step?
The first step is to support open-source science efforts within your communities. The [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is a community-driven guide that provides more details on how to design open projects. TOPS is developing an open science curriculum that will become available in late 2022. The [2021 UNESCO recommendations](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation) have detailed definitions and suggestions on areas of action to support open science.
### What incentives and disincentives are being used to encourage OSS?
NASA awards funding based on the strength of the scientific ideas and the ability to advance those for societal benefit. Traditionally, the enterprise has awarded individuals, but without a focus on openness; incentives have been based on publishing papers in big-release journals. However, NASA will take the next year to shift incentive structures from what they have been in the past, to include incentivizing open science activities (eg. collaborations, team-building, open data, open software, and open-access publications). This shift requires NASA to engage with professional organizations, academia, etc. to make it happen and be appropriately recognized. It is important to note that this shift is not automatic but rather will require some experimentation to see what works and what does not. It is also imperative that NASA get feedback from the community to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of its OSS efforts.

### How do I know that my code will not be taken without proper attribution?

One of the principles of open science is proper attribution of previous work, collaborations, and knowledge used from various sources. Making your code open,  appropriately licenced, and assigning it a DOI will help researchers track code being developed. 

The open development of code should make it easier to identify when people aren’t properly attributing their work. 

### Can you recommend some resources to help people develop their research using open science principles?

One of the goals of TOPS is to develop resources to help researchers, organizations, and citizen scientists do their work using open science practices and principles. TOPS is developing an open science curriculum that will become available in late 2022.

### How can I advocate for open science?
- Make data non-proprietary and available in an open repository 
- Provide datasets in standardized formats and assign them DOIs
- Develop open-source software and code, using best practices and rigorous version control, so that people can reuse it
- Support community development and encourage reuse
- Publish in open-access journals
- Actively engage the public through storytelling (blogging, social media), hack-a-thons, and citizen science
- Cite your data, software, and documentation; use DOIs
