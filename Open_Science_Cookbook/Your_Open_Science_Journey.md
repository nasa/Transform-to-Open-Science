# Guide for Your Open Science Journey

Are you just beginning your open science journey? And not yet sure where to begin? Dive right into important terms and begin working with key tools in **Section 1: Core Open Science Skills**.

Perhaps you have only just begun to post your code or data online, share your pre-prints, or share your null hypothesis as part of your grant application? Or perhaps you are exploring science communication on a personal blog, or are taking a critical look at the diversity in your lab or research group and actively imagining how to make it more inclusive. **Section 2: Engage With Open Science** has suggestions for integrating open science into each step of your research workflow. 

Or are you familiar with open science practices and excited to learn more, and bring others on the journey with you? We invite you to join TOPS on our journey! Jump ahead to **Section 3: Collaborate With TOPS** to get the most out of this guide.

**Are you ready to begin your journey towards open science?** 

## Section 1: Core Open Science Skills

### What Motivates You
Scientists practice “open science” for a variety of reasons. They may be motivated by the desire to make knowledge freely available for everyone, create reusable tools for scientists, or make a particular field more inclusive. In 2013, Benedikt Fecher and Sascha Friesike broke the motivations for practicing open science into [“five schools of thought,”](https://rdcu.be/c1haR) but even these have been criticized for not encompassing all the reasons one might be drawn to open science. 

### The Core Skills
With so many reasons to get started, it can be hard to determine the first thing everyone must do to begin their open science journey. TOPS recommends that everyone begin by:
* Getting an ORCID, Zenodo, and GitHub 
* Learning how to assign a DOI
* Learning how to apply the correct license
* Learning about data and software management plans
* Finding community software repositories 
* Understanding how to hold open meetings

Below, we present you with three easy steps to get started with each core area. You can also learn more about each topic in our ever-growing list of [open science resources](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/Open_Science_Cookbook/reading_list.md). 

### Get An ORCID
An [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) is a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from other researchers. Creating an ORCID allows you to share, and get proper credit for, your data, research, code, and presentations.

- Step 1: Register for your ORCID [here](https://orcid.org/register).

- Step 2: Add previous publications (and code and data sets) to your ORCID by following [these steps](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973133-Add-works-to-your-ORCID-record).

- Step 3: Make sure that your ORCID is linked to your work by enabling syncing with DataCite, Crossref, and Web of Science:
[DataCite integration](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006894594-Auto-updates-in-third-party-systems-DataCite)
[Crossref integration](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971293-Auto-updates-in-third-party-systems-Crossref)
[Web of Science integration](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971313-Auto-updates-in-third-party-systems-Publons)

### Get a GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online version control and code management website, with a rapidly growing community of developers who use and support it. When code–whether it be scripts, executables, or software–is uploaded to GitHub, different team members can contribute to the same file, preventing duplication of work and making it easier to find errors.

- Step 1: Sign up for Github [here](https://github.com/).

- Step 2: It can be daunting to do anything for the first time on GitHub, so we’ve put together a [short video](https://youtu.be/PHoScPeMWHI) on how to contribute to public repositories. 

- Step 3: For a more in-depth start, we suggest [Getting Started with Git and GitHub: The Complete Beginner’s Guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6) and [The Beginners Guide to Git and GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/). If you are looking for something structured a bit more like lessons, Code Academy also has [Set Up with Git and GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/article/f1-u3-git-setup). 

### Get a Zenodo Account
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) is a multi-disciplinary repository that is free to use and access, allowing for any type of scientific work to be freely shared. It is hosted by CERN and is a product of [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/), which creates and maintains tools for open science and open scholarship.

- Step 1: Sign up for Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/signup/). Zenodo lets you sign in with your ORCID or your GitHub, so if you did either of the previous two steps you are off to a good start. 

- Step 2: Integrate Zenodo, ORCID and GitHub. You can ensure that everything you put on Zenodo is automatically synced to your ORCID by using [these instructions](https://inbo.r-universe.dev/articles/checklist/zenodo.html). These instructions also show you how to save a version of your GitHub repository on Zenodo, which allows you (and others) to cite your software.

- Step 3: Explore some of the data openly available on Zenodo using the “Communities” feature, which you can [access here](https://zenodo.org/communities/).

### Assign a DOI
A Digital Object Identifier [(DOI)](https://www.doi.org/) is a unique, alphanumeric code that identifies content (like a scientific publication) and provides a persistent link to its location on the internet. DOIs can be assigned by publishers, or you can assign them yourself using services like Zenodo! The steps below are for adding them to something that has not been formally published, like a presentation you gave at that lab meeting the other day.

- Step 1: Choose a research artifact that you have previously presented publicly, and upload it to Zenodo using [these instructions](https://youtu.be/S1qK_TA52e4?t=145). 

- Step 2: Once it is uploaded, go to the page that Zenodo creates for that work. [Here](https://zenodo.org/record/7410985#.Y5J8NOzML0o) is an example from the TOPS Zenodo. On the right, you can see the DOI assigned to that work!

- Step 3: Add the DOI to your personal website, CV, resume or other site where you share your work.

*Hold up! (You might be thinking) what was that step about choosing a license? Read on!*

### Choose a License
A license lets others know how they can use and share your work, and whether they are allowed to do so in the first place. There are many different licenses, so each of the steps below provides you with resources to learn about the different types. Serena Bonaretti has a great [summary video](https://youtu.be/GlAnKGBnhFY), which is a good place to begin. 

- Step 1: The Open Science Knowledge Base has a fairly concise description of licenses [ here](https://how-to-open.science/share/licenses/), that are used for open science. They also point to [a tool](https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/) that can help you narrow down the list of choices, based on answering a few questions about your work.

- Step 2: Creative Commons licenses grant permission to use the indicated work publicly. Creative Commons (cc) break down their license structure [here](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) and also built [a tool](https://creativecommons.org/choose/#) to make it easier to choose which (cc) license works best for you.

- Step 3: Licenses for code are a bit different than licenses for publications. A well-written blog post on open-source licenses can be found [here, on the Digital Ocean site](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-open-source-software-licenses). The Open Source Initiative also has a complete list of approved open-source software licenses [here](https://opensource.org/licenses).

*Bonus Step: The Center for Open Science has a summary of all the licenses discussed above [here](https://help.osf.io/article/148-licensing).*

### Data and Software Management Plans
Data Management Plans and Software Management plans are designed to help researchers describe the lifecycle of their data and software. In other words, where information will be stored, how it will remain accessible and secure, and where it will be archived when the project is over. Often, applying for a grant requires writing either a Data Management Plan, a Software Management Plan, or both! 

- Step 1. The basic questions that should be answered by any Data Management Plan are available from the University of Arizona [here](https://data.library.arizona.edu/data-management/data-management-plans#5-dmp-questions). The basic questions that should be answered by any Software Management Plan are available from the Software Sustainability Institute [here](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans).

- Step 2: Resources for writing a Data Management Plan are available from Harvard [here](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/plan-design/data-management-plans). Although written to assist researchers with writing grants for NIH, it contains definitions of key terms, and resources to assist researchers with writing their own Data Management Plans. MIT has a similar introduction available [here](https://libraries.mit.edu/data-management/plan/write/). 

- Step 3: A checklist for writing a Software Management Plan can be [found here](https://zenodo.org/record/2159713#.Y5KCHezML0o), and is courtesy of Michael Jackson from the Software Sustainability Institute. 

*Bonus Step: Did you know NASA requires Data Management Plans for certain grant submissions? NASA’s resources are [here](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/engage/new-missions/data-management-plan-guidance)!* 

### Community Software Repositories
The term “community software repositories” refers to groups of researchers (often doing research in the same scientific area) that have agreed to share code using a particular platform. This facilitates the sharing, continued evolution of, and use of scientific research software. The repository that is most valuable to you will depend on your field, where you are in your career, and the tools you use to do your research. 

- Step 1: To learn more about the motivation behind sharing code, we invite you to read [“Share the code, not just the data”](https://psyarxiv.com/hf297/) by Anna Laurinavichyute, ​​Himanshu Yadav, and Shravan Vasishth.

- Step 2: For an example of a community-lead project, we point you to [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/index.html). On their home-page, Pangeo describes themselves as “...first and foremost a community promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science. This community provides documentation, develops and maintains software, and deploys computing infrastructure to make scientific research and programming easier.”

- Step 3: Learn how to get started with your own open project using this [crowd-sourced checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSXBZa3-uBKdkFCkukt5lxRsYoREWNYf0_2OpOnh3mQ/edit?usp=sharing).

### Holding Open Meetings
Holding meetings which are open to the public–or at least to the entire research team–can be challenging, but they also provide an invaluable opportunity to get input on strategy, plans, and roadblocks. By involving those that might not have traditionally been “in the room” when important decisions were made, teams have an increased chance of finding innovative solutions to problems. However, meetings cannot be opened without considering the safety and comfort of everyone in the room. 

- Step 1: Before you schedule your first open meeting, write a code of conduct. Codes of conduct can be used both to moderate an online community, such as a discussion board or a Facebook group, and as well as to set standards for live conversations. Open Source Guides has step-by-step instructions for writing a code of conduct [here](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/). You are also welcome to look at TOPS’ code of conduct [as an example](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of one which is meant to be used both in an online and “live meeting” setting. Additionally, Write the Docs has a [Code of Conduct Response Guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct-response/) that lays out a possible approach to receiving a code of conduct violation. 

- Step 2: When you have your topic for the meeting selected and are ready to begin inviting your guests, be sure to select and train moderators. Moderation is a separate role from leading the meeting; the moderator is explicitly charged with ensuring that the code of conduct is followed, and that everyone at the meeting feels heard and included. In addition to gently taking aside anyone who has violated the code of conduct, this could mean watching for “raised hands” and questions in the chat in a virtual space, or physically walking a microphone over to someone in an auditorium. The number of moderators needed will scale with the size of the meeting, so if your meeting is large enough to have an organizing committee, be sure this is discussed ahead of time. Resources for online moderators are available [here](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-moderate-an-online-community-a-list-of-skills-tips-tricks-280156e8fac4). The National Association of Science Writers details how they handle code of conduct violations [here](https://www.nasw.org/conference-and-meeting-code-conduct) which includes a section of how violations are handled during meetings. 

- Step 3: Ensure your meetings are inclusive. Creating an inclusive environment will ensure that everyone, particularly those who might feel left out of the scientific process, have an opportunity to share their ideas. A few guides to inclusive meetings that we recommend are available from [Harvard](https://edib.harvard.edu/files/dib/files/inclusive_meeting_guide_final_1.pdf?m=1617641674) , [Quiet Revolutions](https://www.quietrev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RC_Inclusive-Meetings-Checklist.pdf) , [Gabi Serrato Marks](https://blog.ucsusa.org/science-blogger/how-to-make-professional-conferences-more-accessible-for-disabled-people-guidance-from-actual-disabled-scientists), and [Kathryn Heath and Brenda F. Wensil](https://hbr.org/2019/09/to-build-an-inclusive-culture-start-with-inclusive-meetings).
