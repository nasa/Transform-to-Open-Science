Open science begins with shared access to data, software, resources, and results. Yet, openness that advances science is not a pure product of technology, it is a product of practices, norms, and community behavior around technology. Just as new technology requires designing new workflows, it is important to deliberately design community dynamics that are welcoming to a diverse community and strategically directs support to include marginalized groups. 

While recent advances have reduced many of the technological barriers, others remain. Many scientists are still unable to contribute because of outdated institutional policies around sharing information, a lack of support to transition towards openness, or they lack open science skills. 

To catalyze and support change, NASA is leading these efforts and championing a new initiative, the Open-Source Science Initiative (OSSI). A key component of OSSI is Transform to Open Science (TOPS) and NASA’s decree declaring 2023 as the Year of Open Science, a global initiative to spark change and shift the current paradigm. 

Over the next 5 years, TOPS will:
- Increase understanding and adoption of open science principles and techniques in the science community
- Accelerate major scientific discoveries 
- Broaden participation by historically-underrepresented communities 

Faster, better, and transformative breakthroughs in science are possible and open science will help us find them.
