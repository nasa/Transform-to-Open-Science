# Open Science Awards

There are several ways that TOPS is advocating for open science incentives.
- Special open science awards that recognize open science practices, community building, data, software, publications, documentation, and/or scientific impacts.
- Adjust existing awards to recognize teams rather than individuals where appropriate
- Update existing award evaluations to include open science practicies.

Some example Open Science Awards (feel free to add more you may know about!):

- APA - The [Open Science Prize](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2015/11/open-science-prize) is a partnership between the Wellcome Trust, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to unleash the power of open content and data to advance bio medical research and its application for health benefit.
- ARCON - [ARCHON Open Science Award](https://www.archonline.nl/funding/archon-open-science-award/). Archon invites students to submit their research for consideration for the Archon Open Science Award. The aim of this award is to recognise efforts to make archaeological research FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Eligible projects will have produced Open Data and/or Open Methods, and are accompanied by an Open Access research paper.
- Event - [Societal Engagement](https://opensciencefestival.nl/call-for-open-science-awards-2022/) Four awards of 250 Euro each.
- France - The [Open Science Awards for Open Source Research Software](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/open-science-free-software-award-ceremony/) highlight projects and research teams that are working on the development and dissemination of open source software and that contribute to the construction of a major common good.
- Finland - The National Open Science and Research Coordination [rewards](https://avointiede.fi/en/palkinto) open science practices. The National Open Science Award is awarded to an individual or a research group, who or which has in their research and/or teaching work brought positive publicity to open science and/or advanced the culture of open scholarship or other open science practices. The Champion of Open Science Award is given to an organization or group which advances the fulfillment of open science practices in Finland, and which provides through their work an example and support for others.
- Human Brain - The Organization for Human Brain Mapping [Open Science Award](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3962) recognizes an individual or team’s sustained and impactful efforts in the area of open science. 
- IBM - IBM Quantum's third annual [Open Science Prize](https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-open-science-prize-2022) — an award to recognize the best open source solutions to some of quantum computing’s most pressing problems. 
- McGill - The Neuro - Irv and Helga Cooper Foundation [Open Science Prizes](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/article/open-science/rewarding-excellence-open-science). The prizes recognize projects, services, tools, and platforms that unlock the power of Open Science in neuroscience to advance research, innovation, and collaboration for the benefit of health and society. 
- MIT - [Prize for Open Data](https://libraries.mit.edu/opendata/open-data-mit-home/mit-prize/)
- NERUN - [NERUN Open Science Awards](https://yerun.eu/2022/11/yerun-open-science-awards-2022-call-open-now/). The awards target initiatives that support the scholarly community to adopt and implement Open Science principles in their work, and that are implemented by researchers and by administrative staff or professional services (in teams of individually).
- NIH - 2017 [Open Science Prize](https://unstop.com/competitions/open-science-prize-wellcome-trust-the-us-national-institutes-of-health-nih-and-the-howard-hughes-medical-institute-17685) is a partnership between the Wellcome Trust, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to unleash the power of open content and data to advance biomedical research and its application for health benefit.
- SPARC - A SPARC Innovator [Award](https://sparcopen.org/our-work/innovator/criteria/) can be an individual, a group of people, an institution, or another group that has been active in advancing openness in scholarly communication. 
- Stanford - Center for Open and REproducible Science (Stanford Data Science Institute) [Open Science Innovator Award](https://seedfunding.stanford.edu/opportunities/open-science-innovator-prize) $1000; ; [Open Science Champion Award](https://seedfunding.stanford.edu/opportunities/open-science-champion-prize) $2000; Stanford Program on Research Rigor and Reproducibility [SPORR Award](https://med.stanford.edu/sporr/rewards/Awards.html).
- UKRI - The [Open Science Impact prize](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/prizes/mrc-awards-and-recognition/mrc-impact-prize/open-science-impact/) rewards an individual, team or network of researchers who have developed and implemented open science practices and principles to make research methods, findings and outputs more accessible, transparent and reproducible.
