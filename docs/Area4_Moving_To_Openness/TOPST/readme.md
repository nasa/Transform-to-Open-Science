# Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Training Solicitation 

Transform to Open Science Training or "TOPST" is a Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) solicitation. TOPST is solicitation F.14 and can be found [here](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=860824/solicitationId=%7BAB776446-03A8-4C24-845D-2E5A2ADA2D5A%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/F.14_TOPST_Amend46.pdf). 

Resources for proposal development are available [here](./proposal_resources.md).

**TOPST element solicits proposals for:**

**1. The development of the ScienceCore, a discipline specific scientific use cases curriculum,** 

**2. Implementation of Summer Schools to teach OpenCore, and** 

**3. Implementation of Virtual Cohorts to complete OpenCore.** 

The training material as well as the design of the learning activities should be targeted to audiences from undergraduate students to established scientists and managers from all science disciplines supported by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD). More information on the ScienceCore is available [here](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/ScienceCore/readme.md) and on the OpenCore is available [here](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md).
