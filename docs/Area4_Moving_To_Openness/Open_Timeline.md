# US Federal Agencies Timeline to Open Science
The White House rang in the new year by declaring 2023 a _[Year of Open Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/)_, featuring actions across the U.S. government to advance open research while accelerating discovery and innovation, promoting public trust, and driving more equitable outcomes. The announcement comes on the heels of the August 2022 Memorandum on _[Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf)_ issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). This guidance marks a major advance in delivering equitable access to America’s research, while enabling all communities to take part in the process and products of discovery. 

The policy builds on a foundation of progress and collaboration across federal agencies, as they have worked to further the goals of open science, catalyzed by an OSTP Memorandum issued exactly ten years ago, on February 22, 2013, on _[Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf)_. This ten-year anniversary provided federal agencies with an opportunity to reflect on the great strides they have made as they for the decade ahead – one that will deliver equitable access to discovery and usher new possibilities across the research enterprise.

Here is a living timeline detailing some of the major actions supported by key policy changes across the federal government as they've moved along the journey towards open science and research.

## 2022

### 2022 OSTP Public Access Guidance
On August 25, 2022 the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued updated public access policy guidance entitled [Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf). In an accompanying blog-post, titled [Breakthroughs for All: Delivering Equitable Access to America’s Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/breakthroughs-for-alldelivering-equitable-access-to-americas-research/) OSTP details how the new guidance increases equity across the federal research and development landscape by making research publications and supporting data funded by taxpayers publicly accessible, without an embargo or cost. The new guidance (colloquialy referred to as the Nelson Memo) calls for agencies with research and development expenditures to update their public access policies no later than December 31, 2025. 

### Chartering of the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Open Science
In August of 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) announced that the Subcommittee on Science had officially chartered the [NSTC Subcommittee on Open Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-SOS-NSTC-CHARTER.pdf). The purpose of the Subcommittee is to coordinate and advance efforts related to open science across Federal agencies. Such efforts include, but are not limited to, making the products and processes of Federally funded research, including scholarly publications and data, more equitably findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable to the public, policymakers, industry, and the scientific community. The newly chartered Subcommitte, building off of its history as an interagency working group, expanded membership to be more inclusive and representative across the federal government and inaugurated NASA as a new agency co-chair (along with OSTP, NIH, and, NSF).

### USDA's Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data
In accordance with their public access plan, USDA releases DR 1020-006, [Public Access to Scholarly Publications and
Digital Scientific Research Data](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dr-1020-006.pdf), requiring that all USDA "peer-reviewed, scholarly
publications and digital scientific research data assets arising from unclassified scientific research" will be made "accessible to the public, to the extent practicable."

### Desirable Characteristics of Repositories
NSTC issues [Desirable Characteristics of Repositories for Data Resulting from Federally Funded Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/05-2022-Desirable-Characteristics-of-Data-Repositories.pdf), which provides guidance on repository characteristics to help make data FAIR and promote equitable access.

### Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)
NIH launches the [Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)](https://datascience.nih.gov/news/nih-office-of-data-science-strategy-announces-new-initiative-to-improve-data-access), which brings together generalist repositories to collaborate on shared efforts to enhance the discoverability of NIH-funded data, including common metadata models, open metrics, and training for researchers.

### NSF Promotes Research Infrastructures
NSF continued to fortify research infrastructures that support data sharing within multiple disciplines. Many individual NSF awards advanced data sharing networks and infrastructures in 2022. Major initiatives included:  
* The [Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable Open Science Research Coordination Networks](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22553/nsf22553.htm) or “FAIROS RCN” program, which supports a cohort of 10 three-year, multi-institutional projects to start in 2023, and committed over $12.5 million to open science from all of NSF's seven directorates. 
* The [Research Data Ecosystem](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/announcements/020422.jsp) data platform to secure and share data at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor. This $38 million investment for transformative and interconnected social and behavioral sciences research is part of NSF's ongoing investment in mid-scale research infrastructure. 

### USGS FAIR Roadmap
USGS publishes [Opportunities To Improve Alignment With the FAIR Principles for U.S. Geological Survey Data](https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20221043).

### NASA Releases updated Scientific Information Policy that is compliant with 2022 OSTP memo on public access.
The policy ([SPD41a](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SMD-information-policy-SPD-41a.pdf)) describes how scientific information produced from SMD funding can be shared.Scientific information includes publications, data, and software produced as part of scientific
activities. 

## 2023

---

### The Year of Open Science
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) [launches 2023 as a Year of Open Science to advance national open science policies across the federal government in 2023](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/). The Year of Open Science features actions across the federal government throughout 2023 to advance national open science policy, provide access to the results of the nation’s taxpayer-supported research, accelerate discovery and innovation, promote public trust, and drive more equitable outcomes. The key initiatives include a unified federal definition of open science: "The principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity." 

### NSF Advances Equity in Open Science
To advance equitable open science and promote public access to that science and to the development of open science networks and cyberinfrastructure, NSF will leverage powerful agency efforts and programs in its [broadening participation portfolio](https://www.nsf.gov/od/broadeningparticipation/bp_portfolio_dynamic.jsp), especially those through the [Growing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Equity and Diversity](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/broadening-participation/granted) program.  Known as GRANTED, this new initiative addresses systemic barriers within the nation's research enterprise by improving research support and service capacity at emerging, developing and underserved research institutions. Public access promotion also complements other NSF efforts, including: 
* The [Minority Serving-Cyberinfrastructure Consortium](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2234326&HistoricalAwards=false) or “MS-CC.” 
* [Build and Broaden: Enhancing Social, Behavioral and Economc Science Research and Capacity at Minority-Serving Institutions](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/build-broaden-enhancing-social-behavioral-economic) or “B2.” 
* New and ongoing award solicitations, such as [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose) and [Campus Cyberinfrastructure](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/campus-cyberinfrastructure-cc), that foreground open science practices. 

### NIH Releases Public Access Plan for Public Feedback 
  
NIH has long championed principles of transparency and accessibility in NIH-funded research. As such, NIH supports the August 2022 OSTP Memorandum directing federal agencies to expedite access to results of federally funded research. The NIH Plan to Enhance Public Access to the Results of NIH-Supported Research ([NIH’s Public Access Plan](https://osp.od.nih.gov/nih-plan-to-enhance-public-access-to-the-results-of-nih-supported-research/)) provides a roadmap for how NIH will enhance access to research products, namely scholarly publications and scientific data, and will ensure these research products are useful and accessible to the public. NIH’s Public Access Plan is now available for public comment. Comments will be accepted until April 24, 2023 and can be submitted through the comment portal found [here](https://osp.od.nih.gov/nih-plan-to-enhance-public-access-to-the-results-of-nih-supported-research/).
