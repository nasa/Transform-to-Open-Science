- Events focused on Science Mission Directorate data, software, or open science practices
- Hackathons, un-conferences, and challenges that build open science skills
- Focused training in open science practices and principles
- Events MUST be openly available and allow for inclusive participation 
- 5-page proposals for ROSES-22 will be accepted until May 13, 2023
     - Potential proposers must confirm relevancy and availability of funds before preparing or submitting a proposal with a SMD program officer 

## [F.7 Support for Open Source Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2022/amendment-41-f7-support-open-source-tools-frameworks-and-libraries-deferred-roses-2023)
Support and maintain open sources tools, frameworks, and libraries that are significantly used by the SMD community. $2M awarded in ROSES 20 to 8 programs, once every 3 years.
- Improvements and sustainment of high-value, open source tools, frameworks, and libraries that have made significant impacts to the SMD science community
- Proposals must:
     - State the process of adding extensions, documentation, and maintenance of the software to support the user community
     - Include an assessment of the potential impact to the SMD science community
     - Proposals for ROSES-22 will be accepted until February 14, 202

## [F.8 Supplemental Open Source Software Awards](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId={0BFB6C2C-5189-507A-FB82-E5A9869DF9E4}&path=&method=init)
Supplemental award to encourage the conversion of legacy software to open source. Yearly, $250K available with a rolling deadline.
- Conversion of legacy software into modern code with open license
- Code released under a generally accepted, open source license
- Proposer must have a research proposal selected for funding through any previous SMD solicitation with at least 15 months remaining in its period of performance at the time of the submission
- Proposals for ROSES-22 will be accepted until March 29, 2023

## F.14 Transform to Open Science Training
Tutorials showcasing open science in action and NASA cloud data, summer schools, virtual cohorts. More information available [here](/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/TOPST/readme.md).
