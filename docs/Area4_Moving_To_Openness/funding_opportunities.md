     - Events focused on Science Mission Directorate data, software, or open science practices
     - Hackathons, un-conferences, and challenges that build open science skills
     - Focused training in open science practices and principles
     - Events MUST be openly available and allow for inclusive participation 
- Potential proposers must confirm relevancy and availability of funds with a SMD program officer before preparing or submitting a proposal. TWSC has no dedicated funding, so proposers are directed to first contact a NASA division, office, or program that may have funding before preparing a proposal. See section 4.2.1 of the NOFO for information to include in an inquiry email and section 7.0 for contact information for Open Science TWSC inquiries.
