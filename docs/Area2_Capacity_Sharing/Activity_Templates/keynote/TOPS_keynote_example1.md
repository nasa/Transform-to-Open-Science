# Keynote Text Example 1

Knowledge is power and when it is shared, we all win. To uplift open science principles across all scientific communities, NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission is declaring 2023 as the Year of Open Science. Open science begins with shared access to data, software, resources, and results. Yet, openness that advances science is not a pure product of technology: it is a product of practices, norms, and community behavior. TOPS and AGU are developing resources to train scientists and researchers in open science practices. The OpenCore curriculum introduces those beginning their open science journey to the ethos of open science, open tools, data, software, and results. It provides participants at all levels recommendations on best practices from subject matter experts.
TOPS is developing projects to teach OpenCore during large annual meetings, special science team summer schools, virtual cohorts, and other events. Throughout 2023 and the next five years, TOPS will:
- Accelerate major scientific discoveries 
- Broaden participation by historically-underrepresented communities 
- Increase understanding and adoption of open science principles and techniques
 
The objective of this meeting is to share details about TOPS activities and ways to participate. To change everything, we need everyone.
