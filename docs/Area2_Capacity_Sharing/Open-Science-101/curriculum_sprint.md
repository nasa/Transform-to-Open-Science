## **A note from the team about working openly…**

We are inviting you to engage while the text is still in draft form.  You will see grammar and potentially spelling errors not normally encountered in a peer-review process.  Our copy editing step is later in August, so please focus on the content and not the fine tuning of the text. We truly appreciate your contributions at this stage.
