The TOPS Team presented background and logistical information while demonstrating the course technology and creation workflow. Leads were able to brainstorm and develop learning objectives and learner profiles to help guide the upcoming course development. The TOPS Team also walked through the anatomy of a lesson, reviewed draft sprint instructions, and discussed remaining logistics and questions.
