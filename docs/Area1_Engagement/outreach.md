### Community Development
We can’t reach our goals solely through inreach efforts. To reach the broadest of communities, our TOPS team seeks to form equitable partnerships with academic institutions, non-profits, professional societies, and other government agencies. When working with others to build a vibrant equitable community, we define our goals and objectives for groups of community partners, focusing on the roles the community partners serve and potential ways we can collaborate. We co-create thoughtful calls of action and together develop a shared understanding and determine appropriate collaborations that will benefit all parties.

Here are some ways we collaborate and communicate with communities:

 - [Host community forums](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums)

 - Participate in webinars at community meetings

 - [Codevelop open science curricula](../Area2_Capacity_Sharing/opencore/opencore.md)

 - Co-create a [forum](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions) with diverse voices/perspectives

 - Co-create articles of success

 - Develop podcast with the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS), a technical society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

 - Collaborate with communities focused on historically underrepresented groups

 - Promote open science in [High Priority Publications](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/tops_publications.md), through a roadshow (virtual if necessary) to brief editorial boards of top science publications, publishing pieces in high priority publications - scientific and popular media forms, and write Op-eds in key publications

If your community is interested in working together, please contact us.

### Conferences/Workshops

Throughout 2023, the Year of Open Science, TOPS will build capacity for practicing open-source science by [attending scientific conferences](./tops_conferences.md) across the nation. 

Our team will: 

 - Build our [email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) and expand our brand footprint 

 - Engage with large conference societies (i.e. AGU, AMS, AAS, AAAS) to designate 2023 conference theme with a focus of open science

 - Lead regular discussions of open science practices and initiatives in 2023 and beyond at many major scientific conferences

 - Educate stakeholders through a comprehensive curriculum workshop

Come get some swag from our booth! We have TOPS stickers and other fun items!

### Citizen Science
We realize that the road to making open science a reality doesn’t begin and end with academics and NASA scientists. We want to reach science-interested populations too! Citizen science provides an opportunity for the general science-interested public to get involved with scientific research to address societal needs, particularly those at a regional or local level, and to advance innovation. [In citizen science, community members “formulate research questions, conduct scientific experiments, collect and analyze data, interpret results, make new discoveries, develop technologies and applications, and solve complex problems."](https://www.citizenscience.gov)

NASA has been engaged in numerous citizen science projects across SMD and this is another exciting opportunity to do more! 

NASA TOPS will promote the inclusion of citizen and participatory science as integral parts of open science policies and practices at the national and international levels through the following tactics. We will: 

 - Host webinars or listening sessions with the citizen science organizations

 - Promote TOPS curricula across their organization/communities

 - Highlight success stories around open science efforts
