# Creating Community: Our Ground Game
Open Science is built on community. Central to its success is diversity, inclusivity, accessibility and equity. NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) efforts can’t be successful without working with diverse communities. When we learn from each other, we all come out stronger. 


With 2023 on the horizon and the Year of Open Science quickly approaching, our efforts revolve around two primary areas of focus: [inreach to existing](./inreach.md) communities of practice and [outreach](./outreach.md) to communities of potential. 

Critical to these relationships is open, candid, and complete two-way communication.  In the spirit of openness and transparency, the TOPS team will hold a series of community engagement forums. 

## Community Forums and Listening Sessions
These sessions will educate the public about NASA’s Open-Source science Initiative (OSSI) and the TOPS program and create conversation where people can engage with us, give feedback on initiatives, and discuss opportunities and challenges. These sessions will feature an open-source science advocate/practitioner or discuss a topic of interest, followed by a listening session where participants have an opportunity to shape the conversation. The ultimate goal of the sessions is to have the community transition into long-term partnerships with increased community involvement.

### Come join us! 

Upcoming Forum: [March Community Forum on Open Science: Challenges and Opportunities for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/20230309_community_forum.md) 

When: March 09, 2022, 1PM EDT (UTC -4)

## Community Panel
The TOPS Community Panel is another way we create community and discover best practices for engagement. This event brings together leaders from the open science, open source software, and data science communities with the NASA TOPS team for a detailed review of TOPS plans and vibrant discussion.  Panelists review and provide input on NASA’s strategy for transitioning to open-source science. Feedback helps us shape engagement and community building practices for the Year of Open Science in 2023. Information on the latest panel can be found [here](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Panels/readme.md).

## Conferences and Workshops

Throughout 2023, the Year of Open Science, TOPS will build capacity for practicing open-source science by [attending scientific conferences](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Outreach/tops_conferences.md) across the nation. 

Our team will: 

 - Build our [email list](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/signup/) and expand our brand footprint 
 - Engage with large conference societies (i.e. AGU, AMS, AAS, AAAS) to designate 2023 conference theme with a focus of open science
 - Lead regular discussions of open science practices and initiatives in 2023 and beyond at many major scientific conferences
 - Educate stakeholders through a comprehensive curriculum workshop

## Citizen Science
We realize that the road to making open science a reality doesn’t begin and end with academics and NASA scientists. We want to reach science-interested populations too! Citizen science provides an opportunity for the general science-interested public to get involved with scientific research to address societal needs, particularly those at a regional or local level, and to advance innovation. [In citizen science](https://www.citizenscience.gov), community members “formulate research questions, conduct scientific experiments, collect and analyze data, interpret results, make new discoveries, develop technologies and applications, and solve complex problems."

NASA has been engaged in numerous citizen science projects across SMD and this is another exciting opportunity to do more! 

NASA TOPS will promote the inclusion of citizen and participatory science as integral parts of open science policies and practices at the national and international levels through the following tactics. We will: 
 - Host webinars or listening sessions with the citizen science organizations
 - Promote TOPS curricula across their organization/communities
 - Highlight success stories around open science efforts
