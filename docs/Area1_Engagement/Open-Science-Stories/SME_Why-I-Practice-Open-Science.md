# OpenCore SME Highlights
[Forty amazing subject matter experts (SMEs)](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/Open-Science-101/curriculum_leads.md) have been working since late June to gather the content for the TOPS Open Science 101. We asked them what inspired them to join the Open Science community and have received permission to share some of their responses here. There are many paths to open science - and we hope some of their paths inspire you!

**Why I practice open science?**
> I faced issues in doing research because the research content available was blocked behind pay-walls and our institution had limited subscription access to research databases. 
The open access initiatives provided platform for everyone to easily access research materials and collaborate on global level and that’s why I practice Open Science; it definitely allows progression in science.

**How did I get involved in open science?**
> While doing different research studies as a student then my job was related to research & development; being an Editor for a journal and all these roles & responsibilities brought me close to Open Science practices. I joined the Creative Commons movement and other renowned publishing platforms for open science & best practices in scholarly communication advocacy because I believe that the right to open knowledge is for all.

**Why I practice open science?**
> Because what other science is there? Science is a collaborative enterprise that builds upon the work of a community, so methods, data and results need be open for it to work properly. You cannot see further if the shoulders of the giants you need to stand on are tucked away behind a paywall.

**How did I get involved in open science?**
> By doing science myself. I new I needed to make my results open and so searched around for tools and best practices that allowed me to do that. That lead me to people and communities that shared the same goals and worked to solve the same problems.

**Why I practice open science?**
> I practice philosophy of the social sciences! And I am a believer in breaking down barriers to encourage more collaborative approaches to science, specifically across disciplines. I apply the ethos of open science to [An Incomplete History of Research Ethics](https://github.com/Ismael-KG/An_Incomplete_History_of_Research_Ethics), which is multidisciplinary.

**How did I get involved in open science?**
> Two simple steps. Step one, I fell in love with the philosophical notion of standpoint theory: traditionally marginalised voices can – under certain conditions – access and communicate information that better informs science. Step two, I joined an [OLS](https://openlifesci.org) cohort to learn more about open science practices in the context of a project of my own.

**Why I practice open science?**
> I always run for having a sense of place in mind to stay in science, because I know I need to reach out to more people, more knowledge, and learn more. From being grown up in a developing county, I felt the lack of resources, training, and facilities! I struggled a lot to get my research published due to a lack of updated open data. Beyond this, I started my study overseas and started getting more resources and facilities! I always feel the responsibility of practicing open science to share my knowledge and resources with others! 

**How did I get involved in open science?**
> With my educational and professional experiences, I started practicing open science. I believe sharing knowledge increase everyone's knowledge. I practice the creative commons when publishing or sharing any knowledge. It offers a great chance for collaboration, innovation, and finally, work for the society!

**Why I practice open science?**
> Because it helps me to improve continuously. I can communicate and collaborate with individuals across the globe due to the principles that open science is based on!

**How did I get involved in open science?**
> Through the communities that I have been a part of. The pandemic brought in a major paradigm shift, which opened up many new possibilities for me remotely. Prior to the pandemic, I used to attend and organize local community meetups only. However, with everything shifting remote - many opportunities were created which otherwise, I would not have been a part of!
I did GSoC 2020 with the Julia language organisation, was a Technical Writer with the R Foundation for building the R Development Guide in 2021, participated in the Digital Infrastructure Incubator by Code for Science and Society in 2021, participated in the OLS-4 cohort as a mentee, Technical Writer with the GSoD 2022 to expand and reorganise the R dev guide - and also continue to participate in many community events!
Also, I would like to mention that the possibility of being able to attend many conferences remotely made a huge impact in my involvement with open science.
