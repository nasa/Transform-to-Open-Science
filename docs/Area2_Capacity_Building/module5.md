# Module 5: Open Results

## Objectives: 
By the end of this module, learners will have an in-depth understanding of how open science principles help with increasing the reproducibility and replicability of research, as well as guidelines by which to choose the best location to publish their research. Learners will have hands-on experience with creating a replicable, open science workflow and using a virtual research environment, and practice with some tools that make such a workflow possible. 

Key Terms: p-hacking, null results, workflow design, study plan, data dictionary, codebook, literate programming, open access [publication], green vs gold open access, embargo period, self archiving, pre-print, “reproducibility crisis”, computational provenance, authorship vs. unique identifiers 

## Topics:



1. The reproducibility crisis and how we can combat it with open science
    1. The “three levels of reproducibility” 
    2. Schwab, M., N. Karrenbach, and J. Claerbout (2000), Making scientific computations reproducible, Comput. Sci. Eng., 2(6), 61–67. [[URL](http://sep.stanford.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=sep%3Aresearch%3Areproducible&cache=cache&media=sep:research:reproducible:cip.pdf)]
    3. TOP Guidelines, [https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines) 
2. What is Open Access? What are the benefits of Open Access? How does it help or hinder general open science principles? 
    4. Green versus gold open access
    5. The [Budapest Open Access](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read) Agreement
    6. Brief primer on the differing business models for open access journals 
    7. Brief primer on how copyright interacts with open access and how authors can keep control of their own work 
    8. (If Appropriate) open access and book publication 
    9. Exercise/Assignment: What is your favorite open access journal? What are the pros and cons of that platform? 
3. Guidelines on how to choose the right open access journal/site
4. Replicability deep-dive; what does it mean to document research such that it is replicable? 
    10. Data repository and data-sharing standards and their impact on replicability 
5. Common issues with results can include (source: Symposium report, October 2015. Reproducibility and reliability of biomedical research: improving research practice [PDF.](https://acmedsci.ac.uk/viewFile/56314e40aac61.pdf))…
    11. Omitting null results
    12. Underpowered study
    13. Weak experimental design
    14. Underspecified methods
    15. Errors
    16. Data dredging/p-hacking
6. Example: Geoscience Paper of the Future from [https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015EA000136](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015EA000136) 
7. Exercise/Assignment: Create a full, research workflow that incorporates multiple principles of open science.
