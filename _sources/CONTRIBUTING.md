## Welcome!

We're so glad you're interested in contributing to Transform to Open Science!

Before contributing, in addition to reading our CONTRIBUTING guide (you are here), we also ask you to read our [LICENSE](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/LICENSE.MD), our [README](https://github.com/reeseIngraham/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/README.md), and our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reeseIngraham/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## We Want Your Help!

No, really, we do! Please come and participate in our community and help us transform to open science together! 

Depending on your level of interaction with TOPS and the TOPS GitHub, visitors to the site can be described as: 
- A **community member**: anyone in the open science community who visits a TOPS site, utilizes TOPS online tools, or attends a TOPS event.
- A **participant**: anyone who posts a comment or poses a question in the *GitHub Discussion Space*, reports a site bug or requests a new resource in *GitHub Issues*, or attends a TOPS event and utilizes any virtual chat features during that event. 
- A **contributor**: anyone who forks this GitHub repository and submits pull requests to make additions or changes to the posted content. If you wish to be a contributor, please read our contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

Everyone reading this wiki is a community member, and we hope everyone will post comments and join discussions as a participant. Contributors are welcome, particularly to help find and point to other open science resources. 

All community members must abide by the code of conduct when engaging with TOPS, either online or in-person. 

## Code of Conduct
The TOPS code of conduct can be found [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Responses to code of conduct violations on this GitHub are based on the level of impact, which is tied to where the violation took place–either a comment, discussion post, or in a pull request (PR) to the repository. Code of conduct violations for the GitHub will be addressed in the following manner: 
* First code of conduct violation 
    * **Participant:** Comment removed + contacted by TOPS moderator
    * **Contributor**:  PR not accepted and removed from GitHub + contacted by TOPS moderator

## GitHub Basics
There are three, major ways to contribute to the TOPS GitHub. 
- **Ask a question, provide an answer, share your thoughts and contribute to brainstorming through [Discussions](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions).** The GitHub discussion area is intended for general Q&A, asking for community stories and experiences, and beginning conversations on new or existing open science topics. 
  - To learn more about GitHub Discussions check out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) 
- **Suggest a change, addition, or deletion to what is already on the GitHub using [Issues](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues).** Issues can be about any TOPS plans, timelines, and content.
  - To learn more about GitHub Issues check out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
- Become a contributor! [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository and [make commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes) to add resources and additional materials.                                                               

## Ways to Contribute

If you do not already have a GitHub account, you can [sign up for GitHub here](https://github.com/). You can also check out these getting started guides *[Getting Started with Git and GitHub: The Complete Beginner’s Guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6)* and *[The Beginners Guide to Git and GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)*

In the spirit of open source software, everyone is encouraged to help improve this project. Here are some ways you can contribute:
- by reporting bugs
- by suggesting new features
- by translating content to a new language
- by writing or editing documentation
- by writing specifications
- by writing code and documentation (**no pull request is too small**: fix typos, add code comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace)
- by reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/pulls).
- by closing [issues](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues)

## Make a change
*This section is attributed to [NumFOCUS](https://github.com/numfocus/getting-started-with-open-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Adrienne Friend](https://github.com/adriennefriend/imposter-syndrome-disclaimer).*

Once you've identified something you'd like to help with you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    [This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

2. Fork this repository to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

    Make sure to [keep your fork up to date]( https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create separate branches for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a pull request.

    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!  
    
    N.B. you don't have to be ready to merge to make a pull request! We encourage you to submit a pull request as early as you want to. They help us to keep track of progress and help you to get earlier feedback.

#### Submit Great Issues
* Before submitting a new [issue](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues), check to make sure [a similar issue isn't already open](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). If one is, contribute to that issue thread with your feedback.
* When submitting a bug report, please try to provide as much detail as possible, i.e. a screenshot or [gist](https://gist.github.com/) that demonstrates the problem, the technology you are using, and any relevant links. 

#### Ready for your Help

## Development Model

For accepting new contributions, TOPS uses the [forking workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). As the first step of your contribution, you'll want to fork this repository, make a local clone of it, add your contribution, and then create a pull request back to the TOPS repository.  

All documentation should be written using Markdown and Github Markdown-supported HTML.
