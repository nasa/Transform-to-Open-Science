# Example TOPS Panel Submission

### Session Description
Over the past few years we have learned some valuable lessons as a scientific community: we are stronger together; we must uplift one another in order to achieve scientific progress; and the best solutions are found when we work together. But these lessons will be unable to spread very far unless we begin to address the hesitancy in transitioning towards sharing data and results and the lack of applied experience with tools which make open collaboration easier. 

Transform to Open Science (TOPS) is a new NASA Science Mission Directorate mission designed to spark a cultural shift to collaborative, inclusive science.
Open science increases access to knowledge and expands opportunities for new voices to participate. Sharing the data, code, and knowledge associated with the scientific process lowers barriers to entry for historically-underrepresented communities, enables findings to be more easily reproduced, and generates new knowledge at scale. Success, however, depends on all of us working to change the frameworks from which we operate.

Through this session panel, we show how open science is transformative and empowering for those who have traditionally been marginalized in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The session highlights students and researchers of diverse backgrounds to share their open science experiences, including their foray into open science, barriers to practicing open science, and successes obtained through an open science framework.


### Why this session?
Open-source science embraces the principles of open science and activates it in a way that unlocks the full potential of a more equitable, impactful, efficient, scientific future. NASA's Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission advocates for open science as it builds trust, advances understanding, and ultimately leads to new knowledge production and important new discoveries. To enable open science, the TOPS team is developing resources and activities that will support and enable the scientific community to move towards open science.

### Revelance to theme or audience? 
This session is particularly relevant to Science for Humanity; science needs to be better, more accurate, and faster to enable the truly transformative breakthroughs that will help us thrive. Closed science, hoarding information and resources, silos knowledge and holds science back. We need more voices, working together, sharing knowledge and resources to find new and unexpected solutions.  Open-source science embraces the principles of open science and activates it in a way that unlocks the full potential of a more equitable, impactful, efficient, scientific future.
