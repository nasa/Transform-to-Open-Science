# Engage with the Year of Open Science

*Individuals and organizations excited to deepen their understanding of open science and ready to begin making open science resources and learning accessible to others are called to engage with the Year of Open Science!*

## Highlight Organizational Subject Matter Experts in Open Science

**What is it?**

Consider your organization’s current open science practice: do researchers use or share open-source code, are pre-prints encouraged or required, is data added to a database or are studies pre-registered? Open science can take many forms, and each is valid. Highlight some open science subject matter experts from your organization at your next community event or online, to demonstrate how research by your organization is already adopting open science practices.   

**How do I get started?**

Depending on the structure of your organization, there may already be a list of those who are freely sharing their research practices or results. Start with that list, and see if any researchers would be interested in speaking to the broader group about how they got started with open science. 

Other organizations may need to spend some time brainstorming, ideally through a platform that allows for diverse participation, about ways in which scientists at that organization are embracing open science. That brainstorming exercise can serve the dual purpose of getting those in the community who were unaware they were doing open science, or not practicing it as of yet, interested in the movement. 

Unsure whether your organization has researchers who are already practicing open science? We recommend the following article to get started: Ummul-Kiram Kathawalla, Priya Silverstein, Moin Syed; Easing Into Open Science: A Guide for Graduate Students and Their Advisors. Collabra: Psychology 4 January 2021; 7 (1): 18684. doi: [https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18684](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18684) 

**Basic Requirements**

When highlighting your organization’s open science subject matter experts (SMEs), you are doing more than just sharing a project that was done according to open science principles; you are also giving those just beginning their open science journey a model to follow. Therefore, to ensure the success of these researchers, we recommend the following be included in the blog, web-page, or meeting in which you highlight the open science SMEs:
* The elements of open science included in their work and research practices (including links to digital elements).
* Any challenges faced when adopting those open science practices, and how to overcome them. 
* Links to the open code, data, or publication archives of your organization. 
* Links to the publication, license, and/or copyright policies of your organization. 

You may also want to consider providing information on the data management plans and publication policies of any federal organizations who contribute to funding for researchers at your organization. Links to many of those policies can be found on the TOPS GitHub at [Open Timeline](/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Timeline.md).

* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


## Highlight Open Science in Your Organization

**What is it?**

Consider your organization’s current open science practice: do researchers use or share open-source code, are pre-prints encouraged or required, is data added to a database or are studies pre-registered? What policies are in place regarding sharing code, instrument data, user surveys, methodology and results? How about instructions regarding licenses and copyrights? 

Those beginning their open science journey often worry that they aren’t truly engaging in “open science” if they are unable to practice openness in every way. At TOPS, we believe it is better to get started and do what you can, than let perfect be the enemy of progress. Show those at your organization how you are beginning an open science journey, by making it easier for everyone to find and access the relevant resources and policies.     

**How do I get started?**

Start by examining official policies that are already in place, including any that mention pre-registration, pre-prints, open access, code, data, research artifacts, publication, licenses, copyrights, meta-data, persistent digital identifiers, digital object identifiers, and/or collaboration. Collect the relevant policies in one location and, if possible, write a “directory” to passages in these policies that align with open science principles. Next, examine any “unofficial” policies; what are the research norms at your organization? Can any be updated to be more inclusive, equitable, accessible, or transparent? Address some of these, as appropriate, in a statement that accompanies the new open science directory.  

**Basic Requirements**

When highlighting how your organization is already engaging in open science, you are doing more than just sharing projects that were done according to open science principles; you are also giving those just beginning their open science journey a model to follow. Therefore, to ensure the success of these researchers, we recommend the following be included in the blog, web-page, or meeting in which you list the relevant policies and practices:
* Directory of organizational policies which include open science principles 
* Examples (provide links) of publications that followed the open science policies that you are highlighting. The projects chosen may not be good examples of every open science principle, and that is okay! Describe what was done well, and point to the relevant organizational practice and/or policy.

## Host a Listening Session

**What is it?**

A *listening session* is an open meeting in which the primary role of leaders is to listen to the feedback, ideas, critiques, and thoughts of the people in their organization. Often, listening sessions are moderated by someone with training in either mediation, conflict resolution, or transformative justice, to ensure that communication is honest, open, and respectful. Attendance is normally capped at twenty participants or less, to make sure that everyone who is present has a chance to speak. NPR has additional information on how to get started in their article “[Six ways to run a listening session](https://training.npr.org/2016/02/16/six-ways-to-run-a-listening-session/).”

An *open science listening session* at your organization would give researchers and scientists an opportunity to express the ways in which they believe your organization is actively advancing open science practices, and areas in which progress could be accelerated.         

**How do I get started?**

Depending on the organization, you may have a group or a person which specializes in moderation, running conferences or meetings, or provides anti-bias, diversity, or conflict-resolution training. Reach out to this group/person and ask them if they would be willing to host and moderate an open science listening session. Once the moderator has been identified, choose a date, time, and forum for the event. Virtual attendance may be easiest, particularly if the group is geographically diverse. Then advertise! 

Listening sessions work best when attendance is limited, to ensure that everyone who attends gets a voice at the table. Best practice is that attendance should be limited to twenty people. If more than twenty folks are interested, you may have to run several listening sessions to get the feedback necessary to generate change. 

If running a listening session will be too challenging (perhaps your organization is too large, or there is no one with training in moderation), a town hall format–in which there is someone sourcing questions but no active moderation, and a larger crowd in attendance–may be a bit easier.  

**Basic Requirements**

To help the listening session be successful, we recommend the following:
* Create an environment which is inclusive and respectful. 
    * If there will be twenty attendees, then maybe consider having only three or four organizational leaders present to hear the feedback. A note-take can be appointed, to bring the areas for improvement to a greater number of leaders. 
    * Choose (or create) a code of conduct prior to the meeting, and make sure everyone in attendance sees it ahead of time. Open the meeting by pointing to that code of conduct, and saying that anyone who violates it will be asked to leave. 
    * If one attendee is “dominating the airwaves,” the moderator should feel encouraged to reach out to them individually (perhaps via chat) to respectfully ask them to make space for the others in the room. 
* Send out conversation prompts ahead of the meeting, to give attendees time to consider their responses. People will appreciate having time to prepare.

To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Resources on getting started with open science, which can be found in the open science curriculum pages at [Capacity Sharing: OpenCore](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md).
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


## Provide Feedback on the TOPS Open Science Curriculum

**What is it?**

Whether someone is looking to transition to a new way of conducting research or just getting started in their scientific career, TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. As such, one of TOPS' priorities is to develop and launch an open science curriculum that includes important definitions, tools, resources and best practices. You can learn more about the TOPS curriculum on our GitHub in [Area2_Capacity_Sharing](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md). 

**How do I get started?**

Join the [TOPS email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) to get our announcements, including the dates when the first version of the core open science curriculum, the OpenCore, is made available for public comment. Once it is available, TOPS and its collaborator on the OpenCore, AGU, will need the scientific community to provide feedback on its content. More detailed instructions on the feedback process will be shared via the listserv soon. Organize a small group of both seasoned open science practitioners and those just getting started to test and provide feedback on the curriculum once it is available! 

**Basic Requirements**

When encouraging folks at your organization to participate as testers in the TOPS Open Science curriculum, be sure to mention:
* TOPS’ goal to train 20,000 scientists, 
* The fast-pass option for those already familiar with open science, and 
* The badging structure (Why badging? Learn more at [Micro-Badging Details on the TOPS GitHub](/docs/Area3_Incentives/micro-badging_details.md)). 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this effort a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* The open science curriculum for testing, once available, as well as instructions for how to provide feedback
* Additional information on the TOPS open science curriculum, which can be found on the GitHub in [Area2_Capacity_Sharing](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md) and in the information from the [August community forum](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/2022_Forums/20220811_community_forum.md). 
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


## Set a TOPS Open Science Badge Goal

**What is it?**

To complement its [open science curriculum](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md), TOPS is creating a series of TOPS digital micro-badges, which can be earned by either completing open science activities or the modules of the TOPS open science curriculum. Participants who complete all five modules will also earn the TOPS open science badge. Additional, supporting information on the TOPS badging program can be found on our GitHub, in [Micro-Badging Details](/docs/Area3_Incentives/micro-badging_details.md).

Organizations can encourage their employees and researchers to support the Year of Open Science by setting a “badging goal” for their organization, and conduct a targeted communications campaign to reach that goal by the end of 2023.    

**How do I get started?**

Some organizations may need to begin by consulting their learning and development groups and/or training teams, to verify the inclusion of pre-existing open science courses in the training packages available to employees and researchers. If there are open science topics (e.g., pre-registration, open access, open-source software readability guidelines), a directory of these courses should be assembled, with the open science topic they cover clearly identified. Any information that is available on the number of people who have completed these courses in the past few years should be collected. This information can be used as a reasonable starting point for the badging goal, as anyone who has received training in these topics will be able to complete the “fast-pass” activity to earn a micro-badge, without taking the entire module. 

Organizations who do not offer training might instead look at metrics such as the number of early career researchers in their organization, or the number of publications submitted in a year which includes elements of open-source code or relies on public data sets. Any of these factors can be used to set the badging goal for your organization. 

**Basic Requirements**

When setting a TOPS open science badge goal for your organization, we recommend the following:
* Let us know so that TOPS can highlight your participation in our own communications. 
* Set up a learning cohort! 
    * Using Slack, MS Teams or other messaging and collaboration tools to help those taking the open science course connect with one another. This may help people identify new collaborators and expose those new to open science to how it is practiced in your organization. 
    * Set aside a particular week (or two) during which many people are encouraged to take the open science curriculum, together. Set up hour-long meet-ups each day during which folks can get together to discuss the topics of each module. 
* Identify a secondary incentive which is unique to your organization! TOPS is providing the digital badge, but maybe your organization is known for a different incentive structure. Could the first 10 researchers to earn the grand badge get a coffee mug or some other organizational SWAG? Be creative, and talk to our team about co-branding. 
* Encourage your organization’s leadership to participate in the TOPS badging program. The TOPS digital badges can be shared on social media, LinkedIn profiles, and added to digital signatures in emails. Have your leaders “tweet it out” when they complete their favorite module, and highlight this in organization communications. (Let us know about it, and TOPS will retweet!)
