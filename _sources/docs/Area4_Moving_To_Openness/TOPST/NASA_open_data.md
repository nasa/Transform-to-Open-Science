# Where do I find NASA's openly available data?

NASA's science data is open to the public through a variety of data archives which are organized by NASA Science Mission Directorate discipline areas. We are providing links below to help you find these repositories, and get started exploring the open data NASA has available for TOPST and other solicitations.

Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA): [official repository](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/alsda) for non-human data generated by NASA's Space Biology Program and Human Research Program. ALSDA data and information is searchable in The [NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA)](https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/).

GeneLab: Open Science for Life in Space: an [entirely open-access resource](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) where scientists can upload, download, search, share, analyze, and visualize omics data from spaceflight and analog experiments. For more information, please go [here](https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/data).
 
Space Biology Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP): [collects non-human biospecimens and coordinates dissections](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/isc-bsp) to maximize the scientific return of high-quality tissues from spaceflight and ground biological investigations. 

NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC): [biorepository](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/isc-bsp) of non-human samples from NASA-funded spaceflight investigations. Samples not utilized by primary investigations are made available through an open science approach via the [LSDA Biospecimen Portal](https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Biospecimen).

Physical Science Informatics (PSI): The [Physical Science Informatics (PSI)](https://psi.nasa.gov/) is an online database of past and current space station, Shuttle and free-flyer flight experiments in physical science, as well as related ground-based studies

To learn more about past, current, and upcoming research projects, search the [Task Book: Biological and Physical Sciences Division and Human Research Program](https://taskbook.nasaprs.com/tbp/welcome.cfm).

## Earth Sciences

[Earth Data Home Page](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-data)

Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS): [process, archive, document, and distribute data](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about) from NASA's past and current Earth-observing satellites and field measurement programs.

[Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/) from NASA's EOSDIS provides the capability to interactively browse global, full-resolution satellite imagery and download the underlying data.

[NASA Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) shares images, stories and discoveries about the environment, Earth systems and climate that emerge from NASA research.

## Heliophysics Data

[Helio Data Home Page](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/heliophysics-data)
*Helio has so many resources on its page that we were unable to summarize them all here. If you are interested in Heliophysics Data, we invite you to check out their [main page](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/heliophysics-data). Highlights are included below.*

Heliophysics Data Portal (HDP): [card catalogue](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/websearch/dispatcher) where users can search for datasets using any combination of time, observatory, measurement type, general location, and other parameters

Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF): provides plot, download, and direct application access to a [large collection of in-situ space physics datasets](http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

Solar Data Analysis Center (SDAC): [A host to many datasets](http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/)
