# TOPS Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of Transform To Open Science (TOPS) is to create an inclusive environment for the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of any identities held, including by not limited to gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.  A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open science citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

We invite all those who participate in TOPS to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to celebrate them. Please feel free to share any kudus with the TOPS Core team.

## What We Strive For

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to participated in outstanding open science. That kind of atmosphere requires an open exchange of ideas, balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive guidelines, people may feel unwelcome.

It would be impossible to list everything staff can do to create a more welcoming space, and we know this community will find ways to be thoughtful in their inclusion of colleagues in ways not explicitly stated here. But when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:
 * Practice empathy and humility.
 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for open science. 
 * Listen carefully and actively.
 * Ask questions, and seek to understand context.
 * Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Treat the identities and cultures of others with respect. Make an effort to say people's names correctly and refer to them by their stated pronouns.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run counter to the culture we seek to foster, we've listed actions that are unacceptable within our community:
 * Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person or group of persons.
 * Unwelcome verbal or written comment or physical conduct based on race, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, or political affiliation.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in person).
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate including but not limited to a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community with or without warning.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
 
## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.  [In-person and virtual activities will also provide further guidance on appropriate conduct at those events.](./docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/code_of_conduct.md)

## Reporting Guidelines

Instances of both acceptable or unacceptable behaviors may be reported to the community organizers at steven.m.crawford@nasa.gov.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. 

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
